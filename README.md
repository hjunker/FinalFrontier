# FinalFrontier
FinalFrontier is an Outlook Add-In to detect and prevent (spear-) phishing attacks.

## The threat: Emotet & Co
Emotet has been the major threat for initial compromise. The attack always involves emails with malicious office documents with VBA as attachments or referred to with a link. With emotet using authentic emails for spear phishing, users are overwhelmed with recognizing such attacks.

## The solution: FinalFrontier Outlook Add-In
In my personal opinion, awareness does not work - typically companies spend a lot of time and money while the improvements are mostly limited. So... why don't we code the methods for recognizing phishy /malicious emails instead of teaching people? This is what FinalFrontier does as an Add-In for Outlook 2016.

## Detection mechanisms
Three levels:
* metadata, e.g. sender information
* links
* attachments

## Installation
